# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those roles to the actual label strings used in this repo's issue tracker (Linear — see `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`).

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                     |

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), use the corresponding label string from this table.

Edit the right-hand column to match whatever vocabulary you actually use.

## Linear specifics

- These are Linear **labels**, not workflow states. Create any that don't exist on the team yet with `issueLabelCreate` — see `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.
- `wontfix` should also move the issue to a workflow state whose `type` is `canceled`, so it leaves the open queue.
- If the team has Linear's native **Triage** inbox enabled, issues sitting in `state.type = "triage"` count as untriaged too — treat them as equivalent to the `needs-triage` label.
